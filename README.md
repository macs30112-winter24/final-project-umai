**Project Goal & Summary**\
Our project investigates which housing attributes and social resources are most valued within U.S. high-poverty neighborhoods. We chooses New York City, City of Los Angeles, and Chicago as the representative cities. Our goal is to identify key housing prices drivers and support evidence-based intervention housing policies. Specifically, we ask: What are the key drivers of housing prices in U.S. high-poverty neighborhoods? To answer the question, we perform a two-level analysis. At the city-level, we distinguish the impact of housing and neighborhood attributes on housing prices. We further test our findings at the inter-city level to improve their validity and generalizability. Method-wise, we hope to inspire computational social scientists working with big data and map visualization to explore robust data processing and mapping tools for tackling large-scale research questions.

**Main findings:**\
***At the inter-city level***\
Neighborhood attributes weigh more than housing attributes as housing prices drivers in U.S. high-poverty neighborhoods. Specifically, in these neighborhoods, within our expectations, larger houses still command higher prices; young houses are still more popular than the old; Asians still tend to find good deals with lower housing prices. Unexpectedly, being closer to parks could mean higher exposure to risky events (e.g. robbery); people do not show more preference towards public transit (e.g. bus).

***At the city level***\
The above findings hold true, but with Chicago showing a preference for single-family residential properties. Specifically, Chicago values single-family residential way more than NYC and LA; LA values business atmosphere more than Chicago and NYC; NYC places less emphasis on the convenience of getting to the hospital than Chicago and LA.
